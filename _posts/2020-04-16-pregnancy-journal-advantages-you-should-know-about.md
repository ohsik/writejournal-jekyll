However, the moment you realize that a new family member will be joining soon, you also realize that things are going to change; in fact, a lot faster than you expected. Your body will go through a lot of changes, you need to make plans for the arrival of the new baby, and there is a lot of other preparation as well that you need to look after. Many pregnant women prefer to keep a pregnancy journal, not because they are not mentally prepared, but it helps them in different ways. A pregnancy journal can tell you about your pregnancy symptoms, test results, food eating habits, and more.

<h3>Reduce stress</h3>
When you go through pregnancy, there will be days when you feel overwhelmed by a lot of emotions. You question yourself if you are ready for it or not. Negative thoughts start to cloud your mind, and you feel like letting out your feelings. However, you fear that others will judge you. The truth is, these kinds of feelings are very normal, and if you fear that sharing these thoughts with others will create a wrong image, make use of the pregnancy journal. Express yourself through words. Stress is not good for both mommy-to-be and the unborn child. Writing down your fear and emotions will help you cope with stress better.

<h3>Manage your time efficiently</h3>
Because you are carrying another body inside you, you canâ€™t really think about yourself only. There is a baby inside, and you need to look after that as well. Pregnancy is the source of hormonal changes in your life. When you make use of a pregnancy journal, you will notice that you can manage your time efficiently. Use the diary to write down a schedule that you need to follow. The types of vitamins your doctor has suggested you take, the amount of food you need to make, and more. When you write down your plan, you figure out a way to stick to your plan.

<h3>Prepare a baby checklist</h3>
A pregnant mother always ensures to keep a baby checklist. The checklist may not only include your daily day-to-day activities but the things you need to purchase before the arrival of the baby. Probably, you are thinking of buying a cute wallpaper for his/her room, few soft toys, change the lights, and more. There are lots of baby products that you keen on buying. But what is the purpose of visiting the baby store again and again, just because you forgot what else you needed? If only you would have written down all of it on the pregnancy journal. This is how a pregnancy journal becomes useful.
