<h3>Five-year journal and how to write it</h3>
<p>Just as the name suggests, a five-year journal is a journal that you keep for five years. Simple, isn’t it? The main selling point of this journal is being able to see the difference in yourself every year and ultimately in five years since the journal is created.</p>

<p>With a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_Journals">personal journal</a> to record personal details every single day can help anyone to reflect on their lives and appreciate how far they’ve come in life. Considering it takes five years to complete the journal, there are some prerequisites that you must know.</p>

<ol>
<li>Use a hardback bound notebook to <a href="https://www.goodnightjournal.com/online-journal">write your online journal</a> or use a digital journal with a regular backup schedule. This is to make sure that your journal is safe and can survive the five-year journey.</li>

<li>You must write every day. Don’t procrastinate, your entries don’t have to be long. Just make sure that you record the most important things. We have talked about forcing yourself to write every day as a practice method many times on the website.</li>

<li>Decide between needing prompts or not. Prompts are a good way to help you write but it might limit what you can write. It’s up to you to decide.</li>
</ol>

<p>Now that it’s done, it’s time to start writing your journal.</p>

<h3>Don’t worry about the date</h3>
<p>You can start today or tomorrow or next week, it doesn’t matter. You don’t have to start on January 1st or the first day of the month. You can start whenever you want. To make things easier you can count until 365 days before starting a new year in your journal.</p>

<h3>Focus on at least a line a day</h3>
<p>Your journal is for you to read and reflect on your life. There is no set of rules that you must follow. If you focus too much on quantity, you’ll get overwhelmed. It’s also the same when you miss a day. Don’t worry too much about it, you can catch up the next day.</p>

<h3>Consistency is the key</h3>
<p>That being said, being consistent is good. It’s a good way to turn writing your journal entries into a habit. You can write during the day or at night to ‘close’ the day. You can write about funny things that people say, record workouts, news, events, a new recipe that you tried, etc. After you get used to it, you’ll start to notice things in your everyday life that you usually ignore before.</p>

<p>A five-year journal can give you a new perspective in life, never mind five years, you might notice it after doing it for a few weeks.</p>
