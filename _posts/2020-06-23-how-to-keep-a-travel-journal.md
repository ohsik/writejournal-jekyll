<h3>Should you write a travel journal?</h3>
<p>If you love to travel and you treat traveling as something that you need to do in order to improve yourself, a travel journal can be very useful. You can use the journal as a to-do list. Write down things that you want to do in your travel and state the reason why. When traveling to somewhere new and meeting different people, write the experience down in your journal as well.
The more you write, the more you’ll remember your travels. You’ll find more things to learn as you write, sometimes you’ll even find things that you had never noticed before. <a href="https://www.goodnightjournal.com/online-journal/anonymous-journal">Writing a journal</a> can also serve as a way to slow things down. Time flies when you’re having fun. You can slow it down by stopping and write about what just happened in your journal.</p>

<h3>Things you should know before you travel</h3>
<p>Now, it’s time to prepare yourself before departing on a journey. You don’t need fancy tools to write a journal but there are some things that you must know and have.</p>

<h3>Go old school</h3>
<p>If you’re a fan of the traditional way to write a journal, you’d need a notebook and a pen at the least. Get a notebook with good protection, you don’t know what’s going to happen during your trip. You certainly don’t want your notebook to get wet or damaged.</p>

<h3>Know what to write</h3>
<p>You can use a theme for your journal. Like, you’ll only write things that make you smile or things that really surprised you. If you don’t like it or can’t find a good theme, you can write about anything you want. Your journal entries don’t have to be brilliant. But if you can get the chance, spend some writing your day in more detail.</p>

<h3>Use technology</h3>
<p>If you prefer to use your phone or laptop or tablet to write, get a great app to write your journal. There is plenty of apps available that you can download. Not just in writing, you can document your trip by recording the most important parts of your travel. You can use the footage later and turn it into journal entries.</p>

<h3>Prepare your gear like a pro</h3>
<p>If you want, you can get a traveler pack to keep a journal. This pack consists of leather cover for the notebook, durable paper, detachable bands, a waterproof bag, a pen holder, and many more. You can buy each item separately or in a set. The focus is to keep your belongings safe and ready to be used anytime.</p>

<p>Now you’re set to go on your journeys and your <a href="https://www.etsy.com/market/travel_journal">travel journal</a> will be filled with many adventures to come.</p>
